## Project Details ##

This sample is part of the Intel® XDK. 
Download the Intel® XDK at [http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5](http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5). With the Hello Admob sample you can show banner and full screen Admob ads within your mobile application. 


The Audio Player App demonstrates the use of the [floatinghotspot Admob plugin](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-admob) to show how to create, show and remove banner and interstitial ads. To see the technical details of the sample, 
please visit the **[included tutorial][]**.

## NOTE: ##

Please ignore the `config.xml` file, the Cordova CLI `config.xml` format has
been changing significantly, especially with the release of CLI 5.0, and this
`config.xml` file has not been updated to reflect those changes. It will not
work as written. It was originally created for use with PhoneGap CLI and has
not been updated for use with the current PhoneGap CLI system, either.
